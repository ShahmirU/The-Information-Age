                  <p>Online  Shopping is a method of buying and selling products and services over the  internet.<br />
                    The concept  of online shopping was first developed in 1979 by British entrepreneur Michael  Aldrich who is credited for being the first person to launch a website that  could enable online transaction processing between consumers and businesses. <br />
                    <br />
                    Online Shopping become popular during the late 1990s when websites like Amazon  were established. E commerce is the process consumers go through to purchase  products or services over the internet.</p>

                  <em>Seventy percent of more than 3,000 online shoppers surveyed in February say      they prefer to shop from their favorite retailer online. Half the      smartphone owners in the group and nearly 60% of the tablet owners use      those devices to make purchases</em></span></p>

                  <p>Online  shopping aims to save customers' time, money and make it more convenient for  them. In this regard, online shopping is very successful as consumers do not  have to travel, pay gas money or spend time walking through shops.

                <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
                  <p>The most obvious alternative to shopping online is to simply go out to an actual store and purchase your goods over the counter. However, there are other ways to shop without having to leave the house which do not involve usage of the internet.</p>
                  <p>For example, orders can be placed over the telephone and then have them delivered to your doorstep. This would save customers time and money but this would not be suitable for all products as the purchase of some products require a visual image to be present in order for the customer to make up their mind.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, some retail outlets offer catalog orders which allow customers to tick off the products they want to purchase and then mail it to the store. The major issue with catalogs are that they may not feature all the products that the store has to offer.</p>

The section should contain information such as how to trust a user, what transactional services to use and how to act if they feel they haeve been scammed.</p>
                  <p>Aditionally they could tell the customer what measures they need to take before starting to shop online. This may include a guide to anti-virus software, firewall settings and strong password options.</p>

                <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
                  <p>Online banking&nbsp;is an&nbsp;electronic payment  system&nbsp;that allows the customers of a&nbsp;bank to view  documents and conduct&nbsp;financial transactions&nbsp;such as withdrawing  money, depositing money and paying bills on a website operated by the  institution.<br />
                    <br />
                  Online banking was first introduced  in the early 1980s in New York after four major banks: Citibank,&nbsp;Chase  Manhattan,&nbsp;Chemical&nbsp;and Manufacturers Hanover started offering home banking  services. However this attempt was initially unsuccessful because the videotex  system used to provide the service was a commercial failure. Contrastingly,  Online Banking became a hit in the UK almost immediately after The Bank of  Scotland set up the Homelink system in 1983. This allowed customers to view  statements, bank transfers and bill payments online.</p>

                  <p>Online  banking is targeted at those bank customers who do not have to go to the bank  to make transactions. Businessmen are good examples as they need to constantly  check if their business money transfers are sent or received. People who travel  frequently also have the habit of checking their balance while on the move. </p>

                  <p>It is not necessary to drive to the bank. Money can easily be withdrawn from ATM Machines which are located in almost every gas station. However, this is only useful for checking your balance and withdrawing money. It is impossible to carry out more complex services.</p>
                  <p>Another option is to simply withdraw a large sum of money at once at keep it locked away in a safe inside your house. However, old fashioned methods such as this may be slightly unwise due to new methods of payments such as credit cards. Therefore, having all of your money in cash form may not be the smartest idea.</p>

                  Much like with online shopping, the main concern for customers is the security. Banks should continually hire security engineers and maintain the system's back up. <br />
                  <br />
This will help prevent cyberattacks on banks and make customers feel more relaxed when shopping online</div>
