                  <p>A multi-user  game enables gamers from across the world to play the same game at the same  time. The internet allows players to simultaneously play talk to others on game  chat to make it feel no different to having a friend over at your house. </p>
                  <p>The  first ever gaming console, the Magnavox Odyssey was released in 1972. However,  the gaming industry wasn&rsquo;t popularized until Atari released the arcade game  Pong (pictured below). </p>

                  <p>The gaming  audience is split up into two different categories, &ldquo;Hardcore&rdquo; and &ldquo;Casual.&rdquo;  This difference isn&rsquo;t necessarily created by age as gaming tournaments can  consist of  40 year old gamers as well as  10 year old gamers. <br />
                    <br />
Casual gamers  just enjoy playing video games as a hobby and to pass time. They aren&rsquo;t likely  to participate in any major tournaments and would only need a console, TV and  perhaps an internet access to enjoy gaming. <br />
<br />
Hardcore  gamers on the other hand have integrated gaming into their lifestyle and many  even earn decent money from participating in contests or uploading content to  social media. They are likely to buy products such as gaming chairs, headsets,  specialized/modified controllers, gaming glassed and any other products that  they believe will improve their performance in game.</p>

                  <p>Today, there are  thousands of radio stations around the world. Thanks to the internet, we are  able to tune into any radio station of our choice. When the radio was first  introduced, its concept was relatively simple. It worked by transmitting  signals through frequencies which were later converted into sound. It was  mainly used by ships at sea for navigation purposes. Now, with everything being  digital, you are simply able to tune into a radio station without the need to  scan for frequencies. </p>

                  <p>Radio stations  do not usually target a generic audience. Every radio station has their own  target audience. In the United Arab Emirates, VirginRadioDubai is the most  common radio station among teenagers and young-adults as it plays new trending  music while the older population tend to listen to DubaiEye103.8 for its  business talks and regular news updates. Almost all popular radio stations now  have live streaming over the internet in order to reach a larger audience.</p>
