          <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
            <p>One of the major differences between western  industrialised countries and less economically developed countries is that, in  developed countries, most people who do not have a computer or access to the  internet do so by choice whereas in less developed countries, communications  infrastructure is poor and even if people wanted to, many of them would not be  able to access the internet.</p>
            <p><img src="../../Images/Digital Divide/extent article.jpg" width="210" height="123" alt=""/></p>
            <p>Thankfully, the digital divide is decrease  as developing countries are improving their infrastructure and more businesses  are looking forward to gaining the online advantage that their western  counterparts have. Experts believe that the increase in digital technology will  enable more people to find jobs and generate more wealth which will increase  the country&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
            <p>Many have asked the question &ldquo;whether the investment in  narrowing the digital divide is worth it.&rdquo;<br />
              Economists believe narrowing the gap will improve the  nation&rsquo;s exam results as a whole because of the sheer amount of resources and  online tutorials available online. </p>
            <p><img src="../../Images/Digital Divide/narrowing gap.JPG" width="431" height="192" alt=""/></p>
            <p>Unemployment rates will also be likely to  fall because of the increase in opportunities for employment. The country&rsquo;s GDP  will increase as businesses us ecommerce to sell their goods to more people  across the world. </p>
            <p>NGOs  claim that there will be an increase in tolerance towards other communities and  cultures as the internet will allow people to become more aware of each other&rsquo;s  beliefs and prerogatives. </p>
            <p>The European Union has launched a campaign called the<strong> Europe 2020 Initiative</strong>. This consists of a ten year growth strategy for jobs and development in the EU. This will cover cover employment; research and development; climate/energy; education; social inclusion and poverty reduction.<br />

          <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
            <p>We live in a world where 60% of the global population does not have access to the internet. There are many factors that have created this divide and each of them should be combatted differently. I would argue that the Digital Divide is imrpving, but at a ver slow pace. The reason I am skeptical when it comes to articles and blogs saying that the Digital Divide is &quot;rapidly&quot; narrowing is because there are technological advancements being made constantly. And with every advancement made, Third World countries fall a step back when it comes to reaching the same level. In Addition, the gaps is narrowing far slower due to the fact the poorer countries have more immediate problems to attend to such food shortages, clean water and electricity. This is why I believe that the Technological factors affecting the divide between different countries is the hardest factor to overcome. On the other hand, Social Factors such as age, will eventually fade away.            </p>
            <p>Another reason, Im skeptical about the gap being bridged anytime soon is that the computer hardware that NGOs often send third world countries is simply taken apart for copper wire and other resources. This is why, it is not just the ability of having access to a computer but the conditions of a country  that need to be looked at to fight the digital divide.</p>
            <p>I think that the digital divide will significantly decrease over time, but never completely disappear. This is because, even if someday everyone has access to a computer and the internet, there will be newer technologies which some people wont have access to.</p>
