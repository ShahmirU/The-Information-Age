            <p>In the online services – commerce section, I  mentioned the numerous advantages to consumers who make use of online shopping  and banking. <br />
              In addition to consumers, businesses also  enjoy many advantages that lead to increased profits. Throught the internet,  they have  the ability to set up websites  and sell their products and services to people all around the world.  Furthermore, by investing in a computer or two, businesses can be more  organised by having all their documents on the PC rather than spending money on  paper. All this adds to a business&rsquo;s efficiency and helps them cut costs in the  long run.            </p>
            <p>Due to the increase in Businesses using ICT,  jobs have been created as specialists are needed to maintain the technology. <br />
              <br />
              <img width="364" height="193" src="../../Images/Digital Divide/The Impact of the Divide_clip_image002.jpg" />	              <br />
              <br />
            Now let&rsquo;s look at the reverse. In countries where technology is not as  prevelant in business activties, they find it difficult to compete with their  counterparts from abroad in terms of efficiency and revenue. Additionally,  there are less jobs created. This means that as unemployment rates in developed  countries begin to fall, they remain the same in third world countries.This has  further worsened the divide. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
            <p>We discussed that the digital divide has increased  the gap between unemployment rates in different countries. Unfortunately, it  does not end there. In every country, there is a technological social conflict  present because there are people who are wealthy and can afford computers and  there are people who cannot. People who do not have internet access are at a  serious disadvantage as they are unable to use the internet to keep up with the  news, socialise with people online or <strong>look  for job opportunities.</strong></p>

          <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
            <p>In the United Kingdom, it is an obligation  for every school to have internet access and to teach ICT to their pupils.  However, this is not the case is many countries.<br />
              Many schools have been pushing parents to  get their child a laptop for educational purposes due to the endless resources,  informational websites and statistics that it provides students with. According  to the Guardian, students who have internet access are more likely to get  better grades than students who do not. This means that they will then go on to  attend better universities and therefore, have better job prospects.<br />

              <br />
              In addition to an exam advantage, students from  around the world with an internet access can get linked together and work on  projects while learning about each others cultures.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
            <p>Although the internet has been a revolutionary platform for  free-speech, there are countries that have limited the amount of the internet  that a user can navigate and banned websites which they believe opposes the  country&rsquo;s culture, tradition or religion.</p>

However, this network has been accused by  the rest of the world for providing false information to its users.  </p>
