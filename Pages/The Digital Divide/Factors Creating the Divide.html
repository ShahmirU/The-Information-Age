                  <p>Being a developed country with very large usage of technology, it is the UAE's job to bridge the gap between countries like itself and countries in the middle east with poor infrastructure and low computer literacy rates. The UAE has called for Arab governments to join forces and establish technological centres in the region such as The Dubai Internet City and The Cairo Smart Village. This is done in the hope that it will encourage people to become computer literate and improve the infrastructure of the country.</p>

                  <p>With the intention of becoming the centre of the Middle East's IT Industry, HH Sheikh Mohammed (Prime Minister of The UAE) invested 200 million dollars into building the state-of-the-art Dubai Internet City which opened in 2000. The technology park hosts prominent technology companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Cisco. Historically, The UAE's population had never significantly been involved with the innovation or creation of new technology. The Dubai Internet City aims to change that by getting more locals interested in IT so that they pursue careers in the field.                </p>

                  <p>The government must take measures to ensure that those living below the poverty line have access to the technology that has become a necessity in today's world.

To obtain basic ICT  Skills, a person must first be able to read and write.

    <p>In The United Kingdom, there are a number of initiatives  being taken by the government seeking to narrow the digital divide. To begin  with, schools and colleges have been funded and awarded appropriate grants so  that they are able to purchase and make use of networking equipment. This will  allow all students to learn basic IT skills. The government is also considering  renting laptops and PCs to pupils.<br />

      In The UK, people who weren&rsquo;t given the opportunity to learn  computer skills in school can learn them through special websites being made which will  have useful resources available that can help with self-learning.<br />
      There is a high amount of competition between communication  companies. <br />
