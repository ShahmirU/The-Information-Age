          <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
            <p>The use of ICT and computers in businesses and organizations  has had a massive increase over the last couple of decades. After the  introduction of electronic gadgets, it became very hard for business owners to  overlook the advantages that ICT bring to business.<br />
              <br />
            There are 5 main factors that contribute to why businesses  have opted to use ICT in either their methods of production, data storage,  communication or advertising. [Open the tab below for more detail]<br />
            <br />
            <img src="../../Images/Life in the Information Age/working styles automation.jpg" width="210" height="122" /></p>
            <p>Furthermore, individual working styles have been dramatically affected. An employee today would have a <br />
            massively different approach to work when compared to an employee with a similar profession a few decades ago.</p>
            <p>These changes in working styles has had various effects on both businesses as well as individual employees. <br />
            [Open the benefits and drawbacks tab to look at some of these effects from a consumers perspective]</p>

          <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Why Businesses use ICT</div>
          <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Thanks to how quickly  computers allow data to be stored, processed and searched, businesses are able  to save a significant amount of time.</p>
            <p><strong>2.</strong> It is possible to save vast  quantities of data in a small amount of space or on cloud storage which allows  files to be instantly accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. </p>
            <p><strong>3. </strong>Everything can be stored  digitally on the computer. This removes the need for large amounts of paper  work<strong></strong></p>
            <p><strong>4. </strong>Businesses can cut back on wage  expenses by replacing workers with machines or computers that are more  efficient.<strong><br />
  </strong><br />
  <strong>5. </strong>It is easy  for multinational corporations to share data and communicate with employees  around the world. After the introduction of VOIP, it is even possible to hold  meetings and conferences online. Companies can also target portions of their  target market through the use of social media and e-commerce.  </p>

          <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
            <p>Businessmen or women can travel or leave the office and still be connected to their emails and work and can be contacted whenever necessary. It is often debated whether or not these devices act as a &quot;leash&quot; on employees as through them, they can be called in at any moment for a shift or asked to authorize something. <br />

              Satellite Navigation is now a feature in nearly every delivery vehicle. It allows the driver to reach their destination via the quickest route possible. It also allows their boss to check where they&rsquo;ve been driving and how long it took.</p>
            <p>The change in working styles has also resulted in increased tele-working and many workers are less likely to commute to work. A major consequence of working from home is that people can easily be distracted and end up doing their personal work during working hours.</p>

            <p>Part of my father's job is to recruit employees for the company he works at. Around ten years ago, the company only had a handful of IT related employees. However, in recent years my father has had to employ several workers in the ICT field such as technicians, graphic designers and data analysts to ensure that the company increases its efficiency by maximising their use of ICT.</p>
            <p>Being a teacher, my mother has directly been affected by the changes in ICT. She is able to share resources with her students over VLEs and mark homework online instead of having piles of notebooks and essays. 7 years ago, her classroom simply consisted of desks, charis and a whiteboard. Now her classroom is equipped with a desktop computer, projector and interactive board. </p>
